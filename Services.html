                    <p> Thinking about going to adult beginner dance classes for the first time? Great! We've probably got a section that deals 
                        with the specific dance style you have in mind.<br><br>
                        However, here, we've also got a bit of really useful info on aspects of dance classes that you may not have considered
                        and may affect just how well you get on in your lesson, no matter what dance style interests you. You can also get used 
                        to the routine of going to the class and there will probably be one or more people that you can chat to about their 
                        dance experiences. We provide you professional dance choriographer from U.S.A, Amanda Anderson.
                        She is also our diet expert who provides the best diet plans from our HardkRock Gym & Fitness.<br><br></p>

                    <p> Imagine an activity that increases your flexibility, strengthens your muscles, centers your thoughts, and relaxes and calms 
                        you. Yoga does all that and more!Many people believe that practicing yoga can help lower blood pressure by teaching breathing 
                        techniques and reducing stress.There is some evidence to suggest that yoga may lower blood glucose.<br><br>
                        Thats why we have the best yoga trainer who is an expert and a professional athelete too and he is none other than 
                        Vidyut Jamwal. Our HardRock Yoga Classes have all the equipments which are required for a professional yoga class
                        like mats,blocks & wedges,straps,meditation hall,etc. Our yoga class lasts 75 minutes. There is a 15-20 minute period 
                        of breathing, chanting, and warming up (according to our Yoga Trainer), followed by the asanas and then 15-20 
                        minutes of relaxation (savasana) at the end.<br><br></p>

                    <p> Zumba is a fitness program that combines Latin and international music with dance moves. Zumba routines incorporate interval 
                        training — alternating fast and slow rhythms — to help improve cardiovascular fitness. Thats why it is one of the most 
                        growing fitness platform.<br><br>
                        Zumba is a total-body cardio and aerobic workout, which provides a large calorie consumption. A study shows that a person 
                        burns 300 to 900kcal with an hour-long Zumba exercise. So, if a person successfully burns 500 calories in each day's workout,
                        then they can lose one pound of weight in a week as one pound of fat contains about 3500 calories. Step into a brand new career
                        and turn that post-Zumba class feeling into income! With endless teaching options + socially distanced classes, you’ll start 
                        changing lives whichever way works best for you.<br>
                        So, what are you thinking of? Join our HardRock Zumba Classes now and become a fitness-freak and live a healthy life-style.<br><br></p>
