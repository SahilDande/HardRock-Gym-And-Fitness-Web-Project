                    It is a short term weight loss program, and hence it is often seen that once a person tends to drop out of this diet 
                    plan, he ends up overeating and again messes with his body physique.<br><br>
                    In addition to the above GM diet chart, some foods that can be included in the diet on alternate days but in limited 
                    amounts include-black tea,green tea,sprouts,a handful of nuts (prefer cashews, almonds, walnuts and avoid ground nuts
                     or raisins),unsweetened black coffee and many more.<br> 
                    We also provide a diet chart with a diet time-table which shows you what to eat and when to eat. It contains different
                healthy soups,different vegetables,different dry-fruits on alternate days.<br><br>
